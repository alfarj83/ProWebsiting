        <p>
            My first year was a bit rough, 
            mostly because I was (and am still) 
            new to programming and had no frame 
            of reference on how to <span class="bold-text">think</span> in coding. 
            My first semester, where we were introduced to Python, 
            was not so difficult. 
            The dreaded Data Structures course, 
            on the other hand, taught in C++, 
            cost me quite a few hours of sleep.
